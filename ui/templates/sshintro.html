  <h2>SSH Introduction</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that allows users to do things like log in to a system remotely, transfer files
    securely, and execute commands on remote systems. There is a bit of ambiguity surrounding the protocol vs. the
    command, so let's clear that up before proceeding. SSH-1 is the name of the original, now deprecated, protocol.
    SSH-2 is the current protocol version. In addition to the protocol, there is the <code>ssh</code> client written
    by OpenSSH. Most *nix operating systems have an <code>ssh</code> client installed by default. Recently, a
    similar client has been making its way onto newer versions of the Windows operating system as well. There are
    other <code>ssh</code> clients; however, we'll primarily focus on the OpenSSH version.</p>

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH provides an encrypted connection between a client and a server. To connect to the server, the client needs
    legitimate server credentials to authenticate. Additionally, the server must be running an SSH daemon (service).
    The SSH daemon is responsible for listening for and servicing inbound SSH connections. All communication between
    the client and the server is encrypted. The client encrypts traffic destined for the server while the server
    decrypts information coming from the client (and vice-versa). The result is an encrypted communication channel
    that is transparent to the user. The most common use for SSH is to log in to a remote system to utilize a
    text-based command line interface. Once the remote shell is connected, any commands typed locally are executed
    on the remote system. </p>

  <h2>SSH Protocol</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As discussed above, SSH-1 is deprecated, insecure, and generally not used. For the remainder of the course, any
    reference to the SSH protocol is a reference to SSH-2 specifically. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH is considered a protocol in and of itself, but in reality, it is comprised of three separate protocols that
    are detailed in three Requests for Comments (RFCs). Links to the three protocols and the overarching SSH
    protocol are listed below</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
        aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">RFC 4251 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture</a></li>
    <li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4252"
        target="_blank">RFC 4252 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol</a></li>
    <li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253" target="_blank">RFC 4253 - The
        Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener"
        href="https://www.ssh.com/a/rfc4252.txt" target="_blank"></a></li>
    <li><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254">RFC 4254 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol</a></li>
  </ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The Transport Layer Protocol provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity. The User
    Authentication Protocol authenticates the client-side user to the server and runs over the transport layer
    protocol. The Authentication and Transport Layer protocols are important, but not relevant to what this course
    aims to teach. The Connection Protocol, however, defines how SSH can do the things that are generally associated
    with SSH (login shells, tunneling, etcâ€¦) and we are definitely interested in those provided capabilities. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The main takeaway is that the Connection Protocol allows SSH to multiplex its connections. SSH multiplexing
    occurs over the Transport Protocol's connection that gets established between the client and the server. The
    Connection Protocol uses the connection provided by the Transport Protocol to allow SSH clients to dynamically
    generate an arbitrary number of logical SSH channels over a single connection.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH channels come in a few different flavors which are listed below.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul>
    <li><strong>session</strong> - A session is a remote execution of a program. The program may be a shell, an
      application, a system command, or some built-in subsystem. Multiple sessions can be active simultaneously.
    </li>
    <li><strong>x11</strong> - One of these channel types is opened for each X11 program using X-forwarding.</li>
    <li><strong>forwarded-tcpip</strong> - Used in conjunction with reverse tunnels (more on this later)</li>
    <li><strong>direct-tcpip</strong> - Used in conjunction with forward tunnels (more on this later)</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH is a rich protocol with many different aspects not covered here. Though, we've touched on enough background
    to facilitate further discussions as they arise. With the protocol basics behind us, let's look at what we can
    do with SSH.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading -->
  <h2>SSH Capabilities</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH can perform quite a few beneficial actions for us and provides us some useful features by default. We've
    touched on some briefly already, but now let's take a moment to discuss them formally.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH can accurately determine whether or not you are allowed to log in to a remote computer. The SSH server
    demands proof of who you are. The proof can range from a username and password combination, cryptographic keys,
    or a token from a network authentication protocol like Kerberos. If you prove to the server that you should have
    access, then you are allowed to log in. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Encryption</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH provides encryption of data by default. Encryption is started before authentication, and no passwords or
    other information is transmitted in the clear. Generally speaking, anyone able to capture an SSH conversation is
    not able to make sense of any of the captured data. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH guarantees that your data is protected in transit. In addition to its encryption, it has a set of checks and
    balances in place that attempt to detect and prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Secure Remote Logins</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>SSH was originally written to replace <code>rlogin</code> and <code>telnet</code> due to their insecure
    implementations. SSH can be used to get an interactive shell on a remote system or execute a single command.
  </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>X11 Forwarding</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>If X11 is in use, the connection to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way
    that any X11 programs started from the shell traverse the encrypted channel. Simply put, SSH allows us to run
    GUI-based programs on the server and see their interfaces locally. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Port Forwarding</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Port forwarding, aka tunneling, allows data from insecure applications to be transmitted over secure SSH
    connections. After port forwarding has been set up, SSH reroutes the connection so that it passes through the
    SSH connection via a channel. The rerouted traffic is then encrypted end-to-end. Port forwarding is the core
    concept around which this course is centered. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Secure File Transfer</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is directly related to SSH and began life as an Internet-Draft right
    alongside the SSH protocols discussed above. SFTP is a separate protocol that rides over SSH to specifically
    handle file transfers. SFTP is designed to replace FTP due to FTP's insecure implementation. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>SOCKS Proxy </h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The other key focus area for this course is SSH's ability to act as a SOCKS proxy. When acting as a SOCKS proxy,
    SSH bridges connections from a client to a destination, using the SSH server as an intermediary. We'll explore
    this concept in more detail later on. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>SSH Based Virtual Private Networks</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>OpenSSH's software can create a Virtual Private Network, allowing two networks to be joined securely via SSH.
    This particular capability is not built into the protocol, but instead is a feature of OpenSSH's software.
    Fortunately, OpenSSH's client is typically found on *nix installations.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
