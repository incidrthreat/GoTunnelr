  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p><code>ifconfig</code> (short for <strong>interface&nbsp;configuration</strong>) is a command that is used to both
    view and configure networking interfaces on UNIX and Unix-like systems (Linux falls into the latter category).
    Because the overall goal of the course is to demystify tunneling, we won't concern ourselves with the
    configuration capabilities of <code>ifconfig</code>, since those settings will already be in place on target
    machines in the lab. The desired learning outcome for this topic is the ability to interpret the output
    displayed by <code>ifconfig</code> when viewing an interface.</p>

  <h2>What is an interface?</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>A&nbsp;<strong>network interface</strong>&nbsp;is really just a fancy term that describes the connection between
    a computer and a network. On Linux, there are two basic types of network interfaces: <strong>physical</strong>
    and <strong>virtual</strong>. Let's take a moment and discuss both types of network interfaces along with some
    common examples of each.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Physical Network Interfaces</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Physical interfaces generally represent some sort of physical hardware with a corresponding device driver loaded
    into the kernel. The physical hardware in question is usually either a Network Interface Card or a Wireless
    version of the same. Some common examples of different names used to identify physical network interfaces are as
    follows:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul>
    <li><code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, <code>eth2</code>, etc...</li>
    <li><code>wlan0</code>, <code>wlan1</code>, <code>wlan2</code>, etc...</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The examples above map to <strong>Eth</strong>ernet interfaces and <strong>W</strong>ireless interfaces,
    respectively. These are two very common naming conventions for physical network interfaces but there are others
    out there. The naming convention for interfaces varies from operating system to operating system. For instance,
    on operating systems that use <strong>systemd</strong> as their init system, network interfaces are named using
    <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Predictable Network Interface Names (opens in a new tab)"
      href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/"
      target="_blank">Predictable Network Interface Names.</a> An example:</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul>
    <li><code>enp0s25</code></li>
  </ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>This is just another Ethernet interface, however, we can glean some information from this naming convention. For
    instance, the example above tells us that this particular interface sits on pci bus 0, slot 2. That information
    is not terribly relevant, other than that it arms us with the knowledge that even though we may encounter
    interface names that aren't <code>eth0</code>, <code>eth1</code>, etc... We'll still understand their
    fundamental capability of connecting the operating system to the network. Our attack-box, <strong>luke</strong>,
    uses Predictable Network Interface Names, which we'll see in practice shortly.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
  <h3>Virtual Network Interfaces</h3>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Virtual network interfaces are software implementations of network interfaces that may or may not be linked to a
    physical piece of hardware. Virtual network interfaces may come in the form of vlans, tuns, taps, bridges,
    bonds, teams, dummy interfaces, etc... One virtual interface you're most likely already familiar with is the
    <strong>loopback</strong> interface. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->
  <h4>The Loopback Interface</h4>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The loopback interface is used by the operating system to send network traffic to itself. One benefit of this
    type of internal addressing is that the traffic sent to and received from loopback doesn't use or require a
    physical device to function. The loopback interface can be used for troubleshooting/diagnostics due to the fact
    that even if ethernet cables are unplugged or wifi isn't functioning, host-only traffic can still flow. It's
    also important from a security standpoint; there are many services that should not be exposed to even internal
    network traffic because they are inherently insecure (the docker api comes to mind, as well as certain NoSQL
    databases). </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The loopback interface usually has an assigned IP address of <code>127.0.0.1/8</code> however, any address in
    that subnet will be routed to the loopback interface. We can see this in action by running ping against
    addresses like <code>127.1.1.1</code> and <code>127.127.127.127</code>. Normally, there is also an entry in
    <code>/etc/hosts</code> that allows us to just use the hostname <strong>localhost</strong> instead of any of the
    myriad 127.* addresses.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:code -->
  <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>vagrant@luke:~$ ping -c 1 127.127.127.127

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The key takeaway from this section we'll need going forward is this:
    <strong>The&nbsp;loopback&nbsp;interface&nbsp;is&nbsp;how&nbsp;the&nbsp;operating&nbsp;system&nbsp;communicates&nbsp;with&nbsp;itself.</strong>
    The loopback interface will play a crucial role in most, if not all, of the tunneling exercises later in the
    course. </p>

  <h2>ifconfig </h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The background about devices may seem tedious, but it's outlined to give us all an even playing field when
    discussing things like dual-homed machines, identifying ip addresses and which interface they're routing
    through. Without further ado, let's jump into the <code>ifconfig</code> command itself. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Due to the discussion above, you already know about one of the interfaces located on your machine. Let's take a
    look at how to query the configuration of the loopback interface on <strong>luke</strong>. We can start by
    running <code>ifconfig</code> without any options/arguments. When we do this, we see all of the active
    interfaces, </p>

  <!-- /wp:code -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>That's certainly useful, but we can be a bit more targeted in our configuration query by specifying exactly which
    interface we would like more information about. This is accomplished by placing an interface name after
    <code>ifconfig</code>. The interface name for loopback is (on most systems) <code>lo</code>.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:code -->
  <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>vagrant@luke:~$ ifconfig lo
    lo: flags=73&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536

  <!-- /wp:code -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Much better! Now that we have loopback's configuration, we'll break down a few of the pieces of information
    returned to us.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:list -->
  <ul>
    <li><code>inet</code> - IPv4 address assigned to the interface</li>
    <li><code>netmask</code> - IPv6 network mask</li>
    <li><code>inet6</code> - IPv6 address assigned to the interface</li>
    <li><code>prefixlen</code> - IPv6 network mask </li>
    <li><code>scopeid</code> - IPv6 scope ID</li>
    <li><code>RX packets/bytes</code> - # of packets/bytes received </li>
    <li><code>TX packets/bytes</code> - # of packets/bytes transmitted</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- /wp:list -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>Now that we've seen loopback, let's explore the differences between the loopback interface and an ethernet
    interface by running <code>ifconfig</code> on the <code>enp0s3</code> interface.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:code -->
  <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>vagrant@luke:~$ ifconfig enp0s3
    enp0s3: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
            inet 10.0.2.15  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.0.2.255
            inet6 fe80::7b9f:ffa7:d2f0:6e27  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link>
            ether 08:00:27:fe:ab:26  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
            RX packets 22  bytes 5900 (5.9 KB)
            RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 52  bytes 7015 (7.0 KB)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0</code></pre>
  <!-- /wp:code -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>The primary difference that concerns us is the inclusion of the <code>ether</code> attribute. The associated
    value is the Media Access Control (MAC) address. Every physical interface has a MAC address, also known as its
    hardware address. Virtual interfaces like the loopback interace and tun/tap interfaces don't have the
    <code>ether</code> value set because there is no physical hardware underneath.</p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:heading -->
  <h2>ip</h2>
  <!-- /wp:heading -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>In the interest of completeness, we'll also take a look at the <code>ip</code> command. The <code>ifconfig</code>
    command discussed above was <strong>deprecated</strong> in favor of a suite of commands in the iproute2 package.
    Notably, the <code>ip</code> command replaces <code>ifconfig</code>, <code>arp</code>, <code>route</code>, and
    others. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>We're interested in both <code>ifconfig</code> and <code>ip</code> because on some systems, only
    <code>ifconfig</code> is available. On other systems, only <code>ip</code> is available. However, on a wide
    array of Linux distributions, both commands are available and we can choose to use the one with which we are
    most comfortable. Let's take a look at output from <code>ip</code>. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:code -->
  <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>vagrant@luke:~$ ip addr show enp0s3

  <!-- /wp:code -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>As expected of a command that replaces <code>ifconfig</code>, we are presented with a little bit more information
    in a slightly different format. Notice that the command to view a single interface is
    <code>ip&nbsp;addr&nbsp;show&nbsp;INTERFACE</code>. </p>
  <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  <!-- wp:paragraph -->
  <p>We can also view all interfaces by simply running <code>ip&nbsp;addr</code> (technically <code>ip&nbsp;a</code>
    is enough, but when training yourself to remember this particular switch, <code>addr</code> is easier to
    remember than <code>a</code>). </p>

  <p>Having read through the material above, we are prepared to answer simple questions about Linux interface
    configuration settings. We should be able to, at a minimum, determine how many networks a given machine can
